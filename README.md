## Repo for MSc Project: Attack Attribution using Threat Intelligence Reports

Contains python notebooks that you can run directly on Google's Colab by pressing "Run All" under run time. Can run locally too, will just need to have the right version of tensorflow (2.9.1) and other dependencies installed

### Two Main Folders:

1. **attack_attribution:** Contains all the notebooks for different Approaches in subfolders: Embedding Layer NN, RNN, Glove, BERT, tf-df (Tensorflow decision Forrests)

2. **model_pretraining:** Contains the notebooks for pretraining BERT encoder with the security corpus. 

The files: 'Final_BERT_Pretraining_with_corpus.ipynb', 'pretraining_on_security_corpus.ipynb' is of interest to the marker, the rest are all practice examples and can be ignored.
