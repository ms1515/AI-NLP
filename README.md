## Repo for MSc Project: Attack Attribution using Threat Intelligence Reports

Contains python notebooks that you can run directly on Google's Colab by pressing "Run All" under run time.

### Two Main Folders:

1. **attack_attribution:** Contains all the notebooks for different Approaches in subfolders: Embedding Layer NN, RNN, Glove, BERT, tf-df (Tensorflow decision Forrests)

2. **model_pretraining:** Contains the notebooks for pretraining BERT encoder with the security corpus. The file: 'Final_BERT_Pretraining_with_corpus.ipynb' is of interest to the marker, the rest are all practice examples and can be ignored.
